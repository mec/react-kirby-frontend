# Kirby React
I recently wrote about using Kirby as a 'headless' CMS for a React frontend.

This is that frontend. The goal was to reproduce the Kirby Starterkit theme in React.

## Still to do

- on the fly routes based on exposing the content in Kirby
- JS way to parse Kirbytext

## Install and run
You'll need a few thing to get this working:

- node and npm
- a running Kirby instance with the advanced branch of the [simple-api](https://github.com/mec/kirby-simple-api/tree/advanced) plugin
- this project

Make sure that Kirby is running on port 8080 or change the setting in api.js
